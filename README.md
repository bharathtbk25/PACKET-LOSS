# PACKET-LOSS
When we access the Internet for sending emails, downloading any data or image file, or looking for any information, the tiny entities of data are sent and received over the Internet these are known as packets. The flow of data packets takes place between source and destination nodes in any network and reaches its destination by passing through various transit nodes.
Now, whenever these data packets fail to reach the desired final destination then the condition is called a packet loss. It impacts the overall network throughput and QoS as due to the unsuccessful delivery of packets to the destination node the network speed slows down and real-time applications such as streaming videos, gaming also get affected.
TCP protocol has the model for re-transmission of lost packets and when TCP protocol is used for delivery of data packets, it identifies the lost packets and re-transmits the packets that are not acknowledged by the receiver

# PACKET-LOSS CAUSES
1) Network Congestion
2) Software Bugs
3) The issue with Network Hardware
4) Security threats
5) Overloaded device and inadequate infrastructure for handling network
